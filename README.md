Mercedes Benz test bench time prediction by dimensionality reduction and XGBoost
This project requires reducing the time that cars spend on the test bench. This dataset represents different permutations of features in a Mercedes-Benz car to predict the time it takes to pass testing. 
Optimal algorithms will contribute to faster testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Mercedes-Benzâ€™s standards.

The following actions are performed:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis including Data cleaning
2. Applied label encoder.
3. Performed dimensionality reduction.
4. Predicted test_df values using XGBoost.
